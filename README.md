1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ans: Var, let, and const these all are variables to set a value for function.
var: Var is Old. Avoid it unless you're maintaining legacy code. It’s prone to bugs due to its function scope and hoisting behavior.
let: Ideal for variables that will change over time—like loop counters.
const: It's a constants, it's ideal for those values that is use particularly for one loop;

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
ans: forEach():Executes a function on each array element.Always return undefined. Uses for  Side effects like logging, DOM updates, or modifying external variables
map():Transforms each element and returns a new array.A new array with modified values.  When you want to create a new array—like converting hex colors to RGB or applying a glow effect class.
filter():Filters elements based on a condition. A new array with only the elements that pass the test. Extracting visible items, active states, or valid inputs.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
ans:Arrow functions are the short form of function().They’re shorter, cleaner. This anonymous functions introduced in ES6.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
ans:Destructuring helps to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables.
It'spulling out values from arrays or properties from objects and assigning them to variables in one elegant line

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
ans:In ES6 template literals are a modern. Injecting variables into HTML, or styling elements with Tailwind CSS classes. The template literal version is clean version.
